 hans.7.desc:0 "§HA deshivelled man looks at us with both a sense of anger, and depression. Just from the look in his eyes, we're able to discern quite a bit on his mental state, and his paranoia towards us.§!\n\n What do you fucking want? Why did you come here and disturb me from my 'slumber'? What makes you think you can just crack open the facility I was living in and explore as you think? You think you can just open whatever the fuck you want [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? Explore to your hearts' content and not even bother to knock or see if anyone lived here? Well, no, you can't."

 hans.7.a:0 "Who are you?"
 hans.7.a.response:0 "My name...\n\n§HThe man pauses for a moment§!\n\nIt's Hans. Just Hans. No fancy fuckin' title like so many others, just Hans..."

 hans.7.b:0 "Why were you here?"
 hans.7.b.response:0 "§HHis face turns angrier and he clenches a fist at us.§!\n\nWell, look at nosy over here. What's it to you? I don't need to fucking explain my whole life to you [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\n§HHis face grows calmer and he relaxes his fist as he takes a few deep breaths in§!\n\nLook, all you need to know is I was here, and now you've broken into my home, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Anything else is irrelevant to the conversation we are having at hand."

 hans.7.c:0 "What are you good at?"
 hans.7.c.response:0 "§HHans' expressions and demeanors change to a calmer one as we ask.§!\n\nGetting people to leave me the fuck alone, or so I was. Beyond that, robotics, AI, exploring, xenosciences, catalouging, yada yada yada. Oh and I'm good at lying, but don't tell anyone I said that.\n\n§HHans snickers at his lying comment and grins a bit at us.§!"

 hans.7.e:0 "Would you like to come work with us?"
 hans.7.e.response:0 "§HHans' face turns to one of shock as he's caught off-guard by our question.§!\n\nWhat? Are you serious [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? Why the fuck would I- Fine. I guess I would, be warned though; I'll only work for you for as long as I am pleased by your 'empire', got it?"

 hans.7.d:0 "How long have you been here?"
 hans.7.d.response:0 "Too long some might say. Assuming you saw the armoury, you'll have an idea. Ideally, I will remain here. Lest you can convince me that working for you and your empire... and maintain it. If you can't, well...\n\n§HHans gives us a glare§!\n\nDon't let that happen and we'll be fine."

 hans.8.name:0 "Fate of Hans"
 hans.8.desc:0 "It has been some time since we have met the xeno known as 'Hans' and decided to say goodbye as they so wished. Now though we must decide his fate within our empire. Be it leaving him alone as he wished, or possibly exploiting them and studying their unique xenobiology"
 hans.8.a:0 "Leave them be"

 farc_situation_energy_pulse:0 "Anomalous Signal Pulses"
 farc_situation_energy_pulse_desc:0 "We have detected a pulse coming from an unspuspecting planet during our surveys. While preliminary investigations suggests nothing major, its structured nature has a large portion in our science division suspicious. As such, some scientists in our science divisions have pushed for the government to investigate the anomalous signal pulses."

 hans.1.name:0 "Strange Pulse"
 hans.1.desc:0 "As we have surveyed celestial bodies within our local region, one of our science ships have detected a strange set of pulses. It only lasted a few seconds, but its unusually structured and uniform nature has some believing it may be a distress call or something else."
 hans.1.a:0 "Investigate the pulses Immediately!"
 hans.1.a.tooltip:0 "Starts Situation §HAnomalous Signal Pulses at 0 progress§!"
 
 hans.2.name:0 "Triangulating the Signals"
 hans.2.desc:0 "We have triangulated the pulses to an insignificant frozen world and science teams are already being deployed to the world as we speak. As the crew made landful, a second set of pulses were received with the same structure and uniformity as the first ones. The second set of pulses have helped us further triangulate where the pulses originate on the planet and teams are being sent to investigate the rough epicentre."
 hans.2.a:0 "It seems things were not what we once thought they were"

 hans.3.name:0 "Finding the Entrance"
 hans.3.desc:0 "Following our exploration of the planet and triangulation efforts, we found an abandoned building on the planet covered in overgrowth not native to this world. How it's managed to survive, we do not know. What we do know is after cutting through it and entering the building, we found a set of stairs that took us underground and to a large vault-like entrance covered in both electronic and mechanical locks. The high-security of the door, the abandoned building on the surface, and the desolate world they're on makes some believe this world may have been a black ops site or hidden research facility. Until we can get the entrance open, we can't confirm anything as of yet."
 # hans.3.desc:0 "We've managed to find an abandoned building on the surface of the planet and through it, an elevator leading towards an entrence into another building that was underground and hidden via the abandoned surface building. The entrence looks to be both electronically and mechanically locked, and may prove troublesome to crack."
 hans.3.a:0 "An intriguing development, keep us updated."
 
 hans.4.name:0 "Cracking the entrance"
 hans.4.desc:0 "We have successfully cracked open the entrance to the facility following the use of directed EMPs against the electronic locks and a combination of drilling, exploding, and lockpicking the mechanical locks. After we got all the locks removed, we were able to slide open the door with help from exoskeleton suits and able to head deeper into the facility itself. While certainly not an easy endevour, cracking the locks was easier than expected leaving some to question if they're mostly for show only."
 # hans.4.desc:0 "We've managed to crack the entrence open after applying targeted EMPs on the electronic locks and drilling through the physical locks allowing us to slide it open and access into the deeper guts of the building. Our xenobiologists have theorized this building may have been a facility for research or a black site to get rid of unwanted people, based on its heavily locked security."
 hans.4.a:0 "Wonderful progress, keep going"

 hans.5.name:0 "Exploring the 'Facility'"
 hans.5.desc:0 "As we enter and explore what we believed to be an abandoned facility, we have found it quite the opposite. While We haven't found any occupants as of yet, there are signs of activity and hints of someone living here. We've also noted the design of the 'Facility' - as its denizens appear to call it - where the walls have etches, or traces, ingrained into them akin to a PCB. Inside these etches, conduits running power and data were discovered and at the points where the 'traces' end, a circle with an access point are present. Though we are unable to interface with it properly, it is by no means a primitive design. Whoever built this facility was likely a civilization with designs and computer tech more advanced than our own."
 hans.5.a:0 "Note down where all the traces go"

 hans.6.name:0 "Discovering life"
 hans.6.desc:0 "Exploring further into the facility, we continued to find more signs of life and activity. Be it random cups, papers, plushies, records in terminals, and markings on the walls; clearly someone lived here. Delving deeper, we found more things about this place that creeped us to our bone, and confounded us. In one room there was an armoury holding weapons from ages past, with dating techniques suggesting some of these to be hundreds if not thousands of years old. In another, there was what was dubbed a 'biofabrication bay'. Whatever that means we won't konw though seeing as how none of the machines functioned. In yet another room, we found what appear to be couches, a table, and a 'primtive' TV, along with a large petbed. We also found what we believe to be a server room after following a flight of stairs donw into it, but none of the servers seem to function and attempts to interface with them went... poorly. \n\nHowever, none of that was as big as this. As we walked back up the stairs from the server room and approached the final room to explore, we were stopped by a xeno shouting at us. Turning around, our team was confronted by a deshevilled looking man, with purple hair, eyes, and formal attire. They do not look to be too pleased with us, and contact is inevitable."
 hans.6.a:0 "Initiate first contact procedures"
